## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Github pages requires a slightly different syntax when linking stylesheets and images.  the '/' before the link needs to be removed in order to load resources properly.

Background images linked in a stylesheet need to be linked using the full web address where they are stored in the github repository.

```css
body {
    background-image: url(https://kpax10.github.io/order-summary-component/images/pattern-background-mobile.svg);
}
```
